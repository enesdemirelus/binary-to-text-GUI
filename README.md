This is an Tkinter GUI application made in Python to convert the binary text written inside a .txt file into a sentence. The application will ask for a file, and after selectiong the file you should do every step with their specifically made buttons. 

Every step should have been put into single button, but since this is a project I made to improve myself, I wanted to see every step seperately. 

An example .txt file is provided.
